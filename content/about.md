Hello, my name is Rachel Hallie Pehrsson! I am an artist and designer currently residing in the lovely city of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I have a BA Degree in Computer Science and Studio Art from the University of Virginia. 

I specialize in acrylic and watercolor painting, with additional experience in illustration, digital art, and web design.
